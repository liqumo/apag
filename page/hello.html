		Led by present Chairman, David Yew, the group at present has an impressive portfolio of 
		30-40 professionals who are currently members. The group hosts a number of events year round 
		providing attendees with an opportunity to liaise with professionals from various industries. 
		These events could be a simple social networking function or seminars where guest speakers come 
		from a number of different industries, such as law, accounting and IT. The concept behind the 
		group is heavily reliant on word of mouth advertising where attendees have a "wheel" effect and 
		constantly bring new professional members to the group to help it grow.
